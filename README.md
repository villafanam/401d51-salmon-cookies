Score (Out of 10): 6

## General Comments

This framework has a higher learning curve. It looks similar to React but it uses the some components differently.  

## Pros
+ Separates your HTML and JS nicely.
+ It keeps your methods, state organized at the top.
+ It gives you a logic functionality on elements. e.g. v-for, v-bind

## Cons
+ Higher learning curve.
+ Rendering is different than React.
+ Limitation on where you can use JS restricted us from properly understand the flow of the code.

## Documentation
It was detailed enough but we didn't have enough time to dive deeper.

## Systems Requirements

We didn't deploy it but overall setup was very easy.

## Ramp-Up Projections

A week to understand the basic functionality but atleast 2 weeks to understand it better.
